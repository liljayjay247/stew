    <p> So last night you had a little to much now your gonna pay for it today.Most people go for Tylenol or some headache relief witch will work but it's easier then that people have been studying this for a long time we got the answer right hear.</p>

 <h2>Treatment depends on severity.</h2>

    <p>Pain relievers can help with symptoms. A severe hangover may indicate alcohol poisoning and needs emergency treatment.</p>




  <h2>What Causes a Hangover?</h2>
    <p>Though other chemicals in your drink – or drinks – of choice contribute to your hangover, 
    alcohol is the primary culprit. And it has many ways of making you miserable.
    Despite how often hangovers happen, little research exists to explain exactly why.
    Here’s what we do know about alcohol’s effects on the body and how it may bring on a hangover.</p>

 <h2>Immune response.</H2>
    <p>Alcohol causes your immune system to release cytokines,
    which are proteins that help control inflammation in your body.</p>
    <p>Those cytokines appear to trigger many hangover symptoms, such as headache, fatigue, nausea, and more.</p> 
    <p>They might even contribute to blacking out, or lapses in memory that can happen when you drink too much.</p>
    <p>They also may determine just how severe your hangover will be.</p>

 <h2>Inflammation.</h2><p>Part of your immune response to drinking alcohol, 
    inflammation may cause some of your hangover symptoms,
    such as feeling generally unwell.Dehydration.<p/>
    <p>Alcohol disrupts communication between your brain and your kidneys.
    So, instead of retaining fluids the way you normally would, you have to pee more.</p>
